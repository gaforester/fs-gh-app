# Example Github and FullStory API App 

This app is just a simple list of the issues in my FS test app repo. I took the liberty of linking my username in github to my email address in order to link to a recent session within FullStory. The frontend us build with React.js. The app is based on a sample app that I worked on previously with a Node.js backend for restful APIs. The list is populated from the Issues API from github. I used other API calls to get the repo url. 

For testing purposes, you can add your own FS Token to fs-gh-app/client/src/components/element/home/Home.js

```
//Uncomment below and add your personal token to test the app.
//let token = 'Basic XXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```
